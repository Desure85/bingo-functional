# Bingo Functional

A simple functional programming library for PHP.

## Requirement(s)

- PHP 7 or higher

## Rationale

PHP lacks the organic support for functional programming multiple functional programming languages like Haskell and OCaml have. The language, however, offers anonymous functions, classes, interfaces, traits, as well as constants which can be harnessed to attain a functional programming experience. Since functional programming is premised on the use of functions to reduce the cognitive burden, the bingo-functional library aims to serve that purpose. Available for use are simple Monadic helpers, Applicative functors, and helper function algorithms which can be used to improve the functional programming experience.
