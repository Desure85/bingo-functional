A simple functional programming library for PHP.

## Requirement(s)

- PHP 7 or higher

## Rationale

PHP lacks the organic support for functional programming multiple functional programming languages like Haskell and OCaml have. The language, however, offers anonymous functions, classes, interfaces, traits, as well as constants which can be harnessed to attain a functional programming experience. Since functional programming is premised on the use of functions to reduce the cognitive burden, the bingo-functional library aims to serve that purpose. Available for use are simple Monadic helpers, Applicative functors, and helper function algorithms which can be used to improve the functional programming experience.

## Documentation

Please check out the [documentation](https://ace411.github.io/bingo-functional) for more knowledge on how to use this library.

Also, a [change log](https://ace411.github.io/bingo-functional/#/changes) exists and can be used to track changes made to the project.

## Dealing with problems

Endeavor to create an issue on GitHub when the need arises or send an email to lochbm@gmail.com

## Functional Programming in PHP

I recently published a book titled - Functional Programming in PHP - which is currently available on LeanPub. The bingo-functional library features extensively in the text as a tool whose potencies demonstrate usage of Functional Programming ideas in PHP. I advise that you purchase a copy for $9.99.
